More than you know it, I'm aware
Of this connection that we share
Yeah, I know it seems like sometimes I don't care
But you are the colours that I wear
It's been a few hours, nearly dawn
You've been real quiet all along
Now I cannot help but think there's something wrong
Hey baby, what's going on?
3 AM we seemed alright (Couldn't be better, couldn't be better)
On our way into the light
Now 3 AM is gone
Along with where there's nothing wrong
3 AM we seemed alright
If I have been thoughtless, let me know
I can take a hint you know
Though i'm a little slow
Just don't keep it in you
Lest it take root and grow
The bottom line here is I love you so
3 AM we seemed alright (Like never better, like never better)
We're on our way into the light
