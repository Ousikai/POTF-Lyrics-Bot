You say you feel a chill in the season 
Like something is falling apart 
You say you can't hold it together much longer
And I should look after your heart
But I feel a change coming on 
Rolling out of the blue like a storm 
And it's bending your will like a willow tree twisting 
Trying to regain its form
How does it make you feel 
When you remember the times the two us lay here 
In the arms of the world on the doorstep of heaven shining down
Do you feel a change coming on, 
Rolling out of the blue like a storm,
And it's throwing your dollhouse world in disarray
So you can rebuild or conform
How I wish you'd only see 
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true before it can leave you
I wish that you could see
Come out shining true all around you
My worth is the look in your eyes
My prize the smile playing tricks on your lips and I wonder again
Do you ever dream of the world like I do
I too fear the change coming on 
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
Can you hear it scream at the hurt that I knew
What is this chill at my heel
That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere
Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along
I feel a change coming on
Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone
