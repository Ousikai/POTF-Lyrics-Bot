Looking at the road that rises up ahead
I thought I'd learned a thing or two
But this is where it's all made new
N' I gotta throw my hands up
I can't go on if I can't stop
Look the leaves are dead
The moments gone, there's no surrender
Forever now unsaid
The words that might've warmed December
Cos it's all inside your head
Like fragments of a dream you remember
So never mind, your clever mind, never mind me
Staring at the ceiling from my bed
I thought I'd earned a chance or few
Thought I'd be paid in due
Time isn't made for waiting
Past isn't worth debating
Feeling like a fool again
Just need a new direction
a new beginning , a new beginning
I can't hold back and I can't hold on
It's all about gratification
See me running, see me running
