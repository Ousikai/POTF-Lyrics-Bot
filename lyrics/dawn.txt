When darkness is no less than everything you've built become undone
There's no fight and no flight, disaster leaves your passion overrun
It's time to let go, it's time to carry on with the show
Don't mourn what is gone, greet the dawn
N' I will be standing by your side
Together we'll face the turning tide
Remembrance, can be a sentence, but it comes to you with a second chance in tow
Don't lose it, don't refuse it, cos you cannot learn a thing you think you know
A new light is warm, shining down on you after the storm
