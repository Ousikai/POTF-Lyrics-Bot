In these days of manmade wonders we still bicker over flies
When you come seeking for forgiveness, I'll be forced to choose my side
If I deny you what you're searching, do I do it out of fear
Am I ruling out my reason, killing that which I hold dear
Out of my way I'm running, with an excuse just underway
Reality's so daunting, and I've got no way to explain
Cos when you're sleeping right next to me, I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name, why do I turn away to run
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds, sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears
In the light of recent findings, there's no greater taint than grace
But to relinquish all our bindings, always finds us out of place
If I rested here a while more, would you hold me to your heart
If I knew what it was meant for, will I know to play my part
Out of my way I'm leaving, another excuse before I'll stay
Reality's applauding, I know I don't know the right way
So when I hear you calling my name, Yeah, I know you're the one
Is it a lost cause,
Can we overlook this taint
Are these the dead laws
Like a doubt eating the saint
And though I fear these shackles, like my darkness closing in
I will hold out my hands, I will hold out my hands
So when I hear you calling my name, I'll know the good I've done
Crying heaven shed your diamonds, diamonds for tears
