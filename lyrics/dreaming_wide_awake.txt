Too late
The melody is over 
The joke seems to be on me 
Cos I'm the one not laughing 
Down here on the floor
Deflate
The mystery of living
In the most heartless fashion I could ever imagine
No pretense of decor
Another place and time
Without a great divide 
And we could be flying deadly high
I'll sell my soul 
To dream you wide awake
Another place and time
Awithout a warning sign
And we could be dying angel style
I'll dream you wide awake
With me
Disaster finds a playfield
Love seems to draw dark
Wwisted pleasure tearing at me
Cos I can't let you go
Mercy, like water in a desert
Shine through my memory 
Like jewelry in the sun
Where are you now
It's like I'm racing to the sun
Blindly face the blazing gun
Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you
Like I'm racing not to run
Give more when I have none
Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you
Wide awake
I'll dream you wide awake
