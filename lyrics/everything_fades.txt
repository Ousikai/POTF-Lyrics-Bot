Silly thoughts of small deeds
Everything that once answered to your needs
The thoughtless but kind
The caring but blind
Everything fades away
Everything fades away, come turning of the tide
For your love I'm sorry
For your pain, don't worry
Everything fades away
Everything fades away
Silhouettes, false leads
That which drew you, like a crow to glass beads
Secrets spied
Wishes sighed
Everything fades away
Everything fades away, come turning of the tide
For your love I'm sorry
For your pain, don't worry
Everything fades away (Everything fades away)
Everything fades away (Fades away)
Everything fades away
All I'm saying is don't give up, you're getting so close
All I'm saying is don't give up, it's the right way you chose
Everything fades away, come turning of the tide
For your love I'm sorry
For your pain, don't worry
Everything fades away (Fades away)
Everything fades away
