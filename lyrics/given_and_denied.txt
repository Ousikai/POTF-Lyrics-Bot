Which way to the fountain of my youth I wonder
Which way to the years I've let go by
Let a thirsty man drink in its memories 
While the water still flows sweet and crystal clear
For yesteryear
Oh to see the sun's eclipse 
on the horizon like ships 
sailing way away from here 
Oh just one more time my dear
Before I'll go hear me out
Cos of this there ain't no doubt
When it's time for curtain call
Fall like a leaf in the wind on the ocean
Of blue like your eyes in the twilight theater
With symphonies playing in the world without sound
We're given and denied
Give me back my innocence cos I wish to dream again
Like I never outgrew my old playground
Where the sun sets slowly with a golden crown 
And the leaves sing lullabies 'round vacant swings
Give me those wings
Let me fly once again
Like I did way back when
I would gamble and win
To lift me high above the din
Of the future we see
Does it hold something for me
I'm weightless again
When it's time for curtain call
