Here at the station
Standing in the rain
Lost in my train of thought
Looking around for a better time again
But yesterday ain't running on this track
Unpredictable fortune
My past
Lights up my future
At last
Ending my torture
Like gravity
Like love
You get up after you fall
I'm not afraid anymore
I ain't afraid no more
Out of no reason I've decided to stay 
Present a solution to the problem
Typical of me
That I concentrate on the destination so much 
That I miss the journey there and back
If gravity was love
