Here at the station, standing in the rain, lost in my train of thought
Looking around for a better time again, but yesterday ain't running on this track
Unpredictable fortune, my past, lights up my future, at last, ending my torture
Like gravity, like love
You get up after you fall
I'm not afraid anymore
You get up after you fall, I ain't afraid no more
Out of no reason I've decided to stay 
Present a solution to the problem
Typical of me, that I concentrate on the destination so much that I miss the journey there and back
If gravity was love
