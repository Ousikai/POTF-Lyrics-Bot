I burn to make you understand
One wrong word 
And it all may come crashing down
For the fates are devious by heart
They envy you your dreams
So they'll let you drown
And there is no why
There is no how, 
It's like the sky
Just one free flow
But you're here right now
And this is your show
So take a bow, 
Cos the show is on right
Here and now 
With all dreams realized
Would you choose 
Still more time to do
Don't fall down 
When it's time to arise
No one else can heal your wounds
Once again 
Taboo becomes your law
What you want seems taken by another tide turning
Away from our flower field 
Where we used to lay beneath the sky
Riding dreams to some other side
Do they burn
The wishes whispered
Like secrets 
They yearn
Just to be heard
I'm done with questions
I have no answers 
The choice is yours
The bigger the lies
The more they want to believe them
And like a vice
Hold on to what they believe in
Don't fall down 
Cos I need you to rise
No one else can heal my wounds
