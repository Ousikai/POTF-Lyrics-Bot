Look in my eyes 
I'll make you see 
We're drifting aimlessly 
Blind in a world of make believe 
Hear them sing their songs off key 
N' nod like they agree 
Buying the needs to be discreet 
I've got no hand in matters worldly 
I hardly care at all 
What's going on fails to concern me 
'Cause I'm locked behind my wall 
But you know what drives me out 
Out of my mind 
Oh 
It's whatever makes you see 
Makes you believe 
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive 
The images they sell are illusion and dream 
In other words, dishonesty 
If I speak ill please
Humour me 
Won't rant on endlessly 
Just thought I'd try to make you see 
It doesn't solve a thing to dress it
In a pretty gown 
A stone will not need you to guess if
You're still going to drown 
So you know what drives me out 
So can you name your demon
Understand it's scheming 
I raise my glass and say "Here's to you" 
Can you chase your demon
Or will it take your freedom
With silence comes peace 
With peace comes freedom 
With freedom comes silence
