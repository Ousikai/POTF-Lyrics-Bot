Here I go again rushing headlong
Without a second thought
Out where reality awaits
I choose to fantasize
And I build myself another piece of
This memory estate
But I can't find the key 
To walk inside my own lies
Hell, the way you walked in
I would kiss the earth beneath your feet
Take me where the angels fall
You take it all
You give no quarter for my love
You raise me up to tear me down
Leaves you reeling
Feels like stealing
Frantic moments of kamikaze love
What you live and breathe 
Is why you're dying
I can see it in your eyes
It burns 
But the waters will not flow
And we watch it all burn down
Just to pry ourselves another piece of 
But we can't find the key 
To unlock its doors for our souls
Broken phrases
Distorted faces
Misunderstanding 
Standing in between
These stolen moments 
Hijack my love
Miss Understanding 
Grinning through her teeth
