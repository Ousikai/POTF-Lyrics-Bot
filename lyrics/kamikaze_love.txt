Here I go again rushing headlong
Without a second thought
Out where reality awaits
I choose to fantasize
And I build myself another piece of
This memory estate
But I can't find the key 
To walk inside my own lies.
Hell, the way you walked in,
I would kiss the earth beneath your feet.
Take me where the angels fall
You take it all
You give no quarter for my love
You raise me up to tear me down
Leaves you reeling,
Feels like stealing,
Frantic moments of Kamikaze Love.
What you live and breathe is why you're dying
I can see it in your eyes
It burns, but the waters will not flow
And we watch it all burn down
Just to pry ourselves another piece of 
This memory estate
But we can't find the key 
To unlock its doors for our souls.
Hell, the way you walked in
I would kiss the earth beneath your feet.
Take me where the angels fall
You take it all
You give no quarter for my love
You raise me up to tear me down
Leaves you reeling,
Feels like stealing,
Frantic moments of Kamikaze Love
Broken phrases, distorted faces,
Misunderstanding standing in between
These stolen moments hijack my love
Miss Understanding grinning through her teeth.
Take me where the angels fall
You take it all
You give no quarter for my love
You raise me up to tear me down
Leaves you reeling,
Feels like stealing,
Frantic moments of Kamikaze Love
