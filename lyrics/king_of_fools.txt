I worry that I can't give you what you need
That you'll find nothing underneath the peel
That I can't undo the times we disagreed
That I can't ignore the way I feel
Cos what I feel is the only truth I know
And I get by on this naivete of youth
If what I feel is the only truth
And what I give out will make up what I'll receive
Can I leave behind my naivete of youth?
Will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
I believe
Could you hold us up 
If I would drag us down
Resurrect emotions from our past
N' if they had a king for fools 
Would you wear the crown
Build us up again and make us last
Cos what I feel is the only truth for me
Can I still leave behind my naivete of youth
And if we don't worry about a thing
Will we be sorry 
When the rain is falling again
And what does it matter
If fortune should favor
It's never the final amen
I believe
