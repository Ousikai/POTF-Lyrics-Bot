In our headlights, 
Staring, bleak
Beer cans, deer's eyes
On the asphalt underneath 
Our crushed plans and my lies
Lonely street signs
Powerlines
Rhey keep on flashing
Flashing by
And we keep driving into the night
It's a late goodbye
Such a late goodbye
Your breath hot upon my cheeck
And we crossed, that line
You made me strong when I was feeling weak
And we crossed, that one time
Screaming stop signs
Staring wild eyes, 
The devil grins from ear to ear 
When he sees the hand he's dealt us
Points at your flaming hair
And then we're playing hide and seek
I can't breathe easy here
Less our trail's gone cold behind us
Till' in the john mirror 
You stare at yourself grown old and weak
