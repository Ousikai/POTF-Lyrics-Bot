Times when I just can't
Bring myself to say it loud
'Fraid that what I'll say comes out 
Somehow awry
That is when it seems
We move in circles day to day
Twist the drama of the play to get us by
And it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong
You lift my spirit 
Take me higher
Make me fly
Touch the moon up in the sky
When you are mine
Where all new wonders will appear
Like the other day
I thought you won't be coming back
I came to realize my lackluster dreams
And among the schemes
And all the tricks we try to play
Only dreams will hold their sway 
And defy
When it feels like fear
Where all new wonders will appear
Oooohhhh
