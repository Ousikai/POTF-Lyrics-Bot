They're locking up the sun
The light of reason gone
N' hope has been succesfully undone
The question's burning on
Where is it coming from
No one seems to know the monster born
It's a bad trip on a sinking ship
When no-one seems responsible
Scapegoat to rock the boat
Yeah
We need someone expendable
Volunteers to face the fear
Can we be sensible
And find a way to break the fall
Find out the cure for all
Is there a hero somewhere
Someone who appears and saves the day
Someone who holds out a hand 
And turns back time
Someone who will never walk away
Who doesn't turn a blind eye to a crime
They're locking up the sun
They have their chosen one
You know this time 
They'll make him play along
They're taking to the arms
The fathers and their sons
There's nowhere left to run and hide
And in the emptiness
There's a solution
Just look within yourself 
For absolution
