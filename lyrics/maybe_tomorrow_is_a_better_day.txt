I'd stay the hand of god
But the war is on your lips
How can I brace myself 
For razor blades on whips
When everything with meaning 
Is shattered, broken, screaming
And I'm lost inside this darkness 
And I fear I won't survive
I could pray and trick with a double tongue
But the only fool here's me
I choose the way to go
But the road won't set me free
Cos I wish you'd see me, baby 
Save me, I'm going crazy
Tryin' to keep us real
Keep us alive
This day will die tonight 
And there ain't no exception
We shouldn't wait for nothing to wait for
Love me in this fable, babe
Ny heart is in your hand
Our time is waiting right outside your door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day
I do not deal the cards 
And I play a lousy hand
I celebrate no victories
And my promises are sand
Against all this I contrast you
When all is lost the war is through
Hey angel
Dare the winds 
Now we can fly
Why should I wait 
For nothing to wait for
Let me love you in this fable
Hold your heart in my hand
I won't cry for my solitude
Lay my head and dream of you
And hope that you'll come knocking on my door
I know tomorrow is a better day
