Yeah decency
She done left our home
On her rollerskates
So I guess she's pretty far gone
Left me with my greed
To answer for my own
For how could a deadened sense tell right from wrong
So thanks for nothing 
I ain't feeling the magic
Kinda comic how I got tragic
Mirror mirror on the wall
What do you give someone ho has it all
More, just to be sure
I got what I wanted
So naturally I want more
What I paid for
Entertain me now
All I want is more
Cos I like it
Too good to let it go
Keep it coming
Cos I want more
cos I'm not sure
What I really wanted
So all I want is more
Yeah modesty
Her rule now overthrown
Packed her teddybear
So as not to go alone
Left me with my pride 
To live beneath a stone
For how could an amputee ever pick a bone
So tell me something
Isn't this a bit drastic
My smiles are turning to plastic
What's the secret for staying droll
You know it isn't particularly funny
Killjoy walks in just when it's turning sunny
Killjoy lives like it's all about the money
All about the money
