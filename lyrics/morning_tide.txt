Rise with me now
And we'll walk to the shore
We'll look over the waves
To the break of day
I'll hold your hand
I'll hold you close
I'll wipe away your tears
And no one will know
On the morning tide
We'll hoist the sails 
To brave the crashing waves
Won't you come with me 
And hear the ocean sigh
And if to its depths
It called us by our names
Won't you sail to the shore with me
Come to me now
And together we'll go
Where the clear winds blow
Far and beyond
Leaving behind
All our sorrow and pride
Kissin' them goodbye
Into another life
Won't you come with me
Sail to the shore with me
Love is still here
Never will it leave
You're always with me
And I' always with you
