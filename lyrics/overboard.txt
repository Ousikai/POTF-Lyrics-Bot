I see you crying and it rains
Washing away the bad days
Washing away the pain loss brings yeah
And then you smile though it aches
Cos you don't believe in mistakes
Just that we made a mess of things
When the deal that you made with love is now a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you're incomplete, incomplete
You're not afraid to rely
On any way you can try
To learn to make some sense of things yeah
And the way you say we'll get by
With a little laugh we can fly
You know the measure of hope that brings
When the deal that you made with love is just a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you're incomplete, incomplete
I hear you laughing like a child
Instead of choking all riled
Instead of staring at shortcomings yeah
Just like the rain when you cried
Washed all the stains of false pride
You'll learn to make the best of things
Have a little more of not enough
More of what is less but isn't love
Little of the same you're dreaming of
That's enough, that's enough
When the deal that you made with love is now a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you're incomplete, incomplete
When the deal that you made with love is just a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you are in-complete yeah
When the deal that you made with love is now a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you're incomplete, incomplete
When the deal that you made with love is just a one way street
A one way street
And you'll feel you'll go overboard
Cos you're incomplete, incomplete
