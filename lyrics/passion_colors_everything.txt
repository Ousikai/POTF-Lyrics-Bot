This is my toothpaste moment, oh, I'll need to flash a smile
I'll be the super-absorbent-man, watch them flock to me in single file
And I'll need to do it with style, I need to keep me up to date
Swallowing the sun run another mile, it's overrated how we underrate
I dance in tune with what I fear
To do adrenaline
Completely rapt with what I hear
When passion colors everything
The songs I sing, from way out there to deep within
The face I wear behind my grin
The price I've paid for my original sin
Everything, everything, everything
I have a mind for simple things, but things are not of mind to simplify
There's always some loophole technicality you buy into and pay until you die
Money doesn't bring me joy, it's more like a darling dead weight
And I seem to have lost my appetite, it's underrated how we overrate
I dance entangled with my dear
She pulls my every string
Completely trapped yet never here
And when I'm finally brought to my senses
Parade the rain on my parade
Before I'm back to my defenses
To watch the whole thing escalate
