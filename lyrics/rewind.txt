What do we have but illusions 
Where one man's absolute is another's choice
Giving in to confusion
Till love and hate both tempt with the same voice
Won't you take me to a higher ground
I need to see again the way I'm bound
N' choose the uneasy redemption
Run by fear and the flaws of attraction
Rewind
I wanna go it again
Light up the dark
Halo on the side
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting
I see my heart
Waving me bye-bye
If life itself has a meaning
Is it anything more than what we choose to call it
Sweet words make appealing
But they only serve to mask the smell of what you buried 
Is it worth your while to spend on a lie
Even though you cannot see eye to eye
N' give in to the rumor seduction
Run by fear and all the good intentions
So I'll know it will not leave me wanting
Like my love
Kissing me good bye
If this is how we think we make amends
We're in for a race that never ends
Where is it we think we'll go
What is it we think we know
It'll never change until we change ourselves
