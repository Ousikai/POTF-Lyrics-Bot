I've walked the distance
I paid my dues 
And tried to have a go 
At what I thought I knew was real
Held no appeal
I've been to places
I've seen the tidings
I bought a book of rules 
For every coin that I could steal
And so I came to gaze upon the stars
When they were yet unborn
And consequently
Tear at my old scars
And the mask I had outworn
So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone
Grow me a garden of roses
Paint me the colors of sky and rain
Teach me to speak with their voices
Show me the way and I'll try again
I've heard the rumors
Started fires
I sowed a sordid lot of plays 
For keeps 
For what I need
Behold
The demons that I freed
I've tried my best at wearing the hard hat
But healing doesn't seem to happen 
When you hide away the seed
And so I came across the medicine man
And he showed me what I'd forlorn
For if I'm stayed it happens by my own hand
And my own voice full of scorn
Without you I'm nothing at all
And life has the face of a morbid game
With you nothing seems impossible
It all seems to fit the frame
