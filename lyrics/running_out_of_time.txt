Here's my confession
'Cus I can't keep it in me
And you know I'm breathless 
As I come undone
Undone before you
Loving every heartache
Revel in every twist and turn
I can feel your wisdom burning me
Like a second sun
Please forgive me
I can't lay down to waste time
Going crazy 
Running out of time
When you're leaving me
Am I still hanging on 
To the ends of yesterday in me
When I was crying for my fears
Bitter tears
But you made me see we're crazy running 
Crazy running 
Like we're running out of time
Take my aggression as a gift 
To show us what we need to change
Thoughts we need to rearrange 
'Cus we're alright now
Though I don't bow to authority
Right and wrong are my left and right
And this feels like we're crazy running 
Like we're running out of time
Forgive me 
I can't lay down waiting
Still defining all my fears
You made me see we're crazy running 
Why's it feel
Like it kills
You're not leaving me
