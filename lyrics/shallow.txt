More in my face 
Than is my taste 
I grow so weary I'll surrender 
To what they say
Let them lead the way 
Till' I can no longer remember 
My darling dreams
Prewritten scenes 
Whatever felt my own 
So to save face
I'll take my place 
Where I may safely feel alone 
Glad the waters are so shallow 
When the river runs so cold 
When the river runs cold
I'm quick to wait
And slow to hate 
They call me gracious for my patience 
And I feel proud under that shroud 
And all the while it's all evasion 
Some humor here to fend off fear 
And I'm a little more lost, oh dear 
So to save face
I'll hold my place 
So I may safely feel alone
