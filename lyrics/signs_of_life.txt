She stands by the corner shop
At the edge of a rainbow 
She thought the solution
Someone painted on the wall
He writes in his daily journal
Eyes blindfolded
Gathering pieces
With no direction to go anymore
When what's real becomes 
Just another source of hurt
And when meaning's gone from every word
Signs of life
Color of your skin
Emotions within
Show you the fast lane to your love
When love is a kiss
Of terminal bliss
Designed to erase all signs of life
From the smile on your face
To the lines you rephrase
We'll always guide you to your love
Your love is a kiss
My undying wish
Designed to retrace the signs of life
Signs of life
She disguises herself in a New York fashion
To find her passion
She lights her beacon
High on coffee shop reviews
And he still picks his dreams by chance
Chooses opinions to fit his circumstance
To find something he can use
When you're free to choose 
But the choices leave you lost
When you feel you paid way more then it should cost
If you feel you've exhausted all your options
And if you still find yourself with nothing to believe in
Free your mind, and you will see
Free your mind
And you will see
See, see
