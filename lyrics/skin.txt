We made ourselves a home 
Out of our dreams
Brought with us this love 
Now bittersweet
Maybe I could say now 
That I always thought of you
How you run to walk with me 
Your whole life through
And I know we go deeper than skin 
But what lies within
It's still deeper than we know
And for all this pantomime
You should see the state I'm in
I couldn't heal myself with time alone
I have you tattooed on my skin
This house is full of storie we both told
These rooms
Their very stage where they'd unfold
These walls
They whisper secrets and memories thereof
This door no longer leads us to their love
All I ever wanted was to hold you
What can I do now to make things new
I ain't trying to write you into a song
'Cause you're too sacred 
And I would feel wrong
But when irony life holds
I was finally ready to meet you half way
You turned and walked away
I have you tattooed on my skin
