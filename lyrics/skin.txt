We made ourselves home out of our dreams
Brought with us this love now bittersweet
Maybe I could say now that I always thought of you
How you run to walk with me whole life through
And I know we go deeper than skin but what lies within
It's still deeper than we know
And for all this pantomime
You should see the state I'm in
I couldn't heal myself with time alone
I have you tattooed on my skin
This house is full of stories we both told
These rooms, their very stage where they'd unfold
These walls, they whisper secrets and memories thereof
This door no longer leads us to their love
And I know we go deeper than skin but what lies within
It's still deeper than we know
And for all this pantomime
You should see the state I'm in
I couldn't heal myself with time alone
I have you tattooed on my skin
All I ever wanted was to hold you
What can I do now to make things new
I ain't trying to write you into a song
'Cause you're too sacred and I would feel wrong
But when irony life holds,
I was finally ready to meet you half way
You turned and walked away
And for all this pantomime
You should see the state I'm in
I couldn't heal myself with time alone
I have you tattooed on my skin
I couldn't heal myself with time alone
I have you tattooed on my skin
