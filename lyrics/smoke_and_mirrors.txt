I danced a tango with my hubris high on youth
We swept across the dance floor to subjective truth
But there was no harmony there
No reason for coexistence
Nothing to span the distance now
Do we even know who we are
Living like all life is forfeit
Like we can just go redefine it
Regardless what we broke
Who died and made us stars
With our intellectual gambits
Our millionaire flair and our antics
We're like mirrors seen through smoke
I tried a shanty with the fool to find my pace
Anything from puns to jests to intertwine our ways
But there was no loyalty to hope
And funny the need for mercy
How it makes us bleed all mercy now
Now the melody's void of sympathy
Cos that shit's in byte size bits on YouTube
so tell me what am I supposed to do
When the malady's no remedy
Till we reach the lowest absolute
And necessity will finally force something through what's walling you
