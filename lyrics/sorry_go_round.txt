The devil may smile with an angel's face
A cat may be stolen of its grace
They say it's just a matter of time and place
A man may be less than an animal
The antichrist write up the honor roll
The tightrope walker take the final fall
At his house 
In the bathroom
On a holiday
And that's in the news
Oh, the things you see
Makes ignorance bliss for you and me
Yeah
When arrogance does publicity
Smiling happily
It's a merry go round 
And around and around
The begging boy becomes the begging man
The zealot never saves the sacrificial lamb
And a child want's to know if the candyman can
Everybody wants the fancy car
And we've all been told not to run too far
But everybody wants to be a rock'n'roll star
Makes arrogance seem the way to be
When ignorance spreads conformity
