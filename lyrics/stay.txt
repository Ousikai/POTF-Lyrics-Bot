Morning comes slow today
Memories push through from yesterday
Where will I be tomorrow
What do I have to show
From my life
Stay, I need you here for a new day to break
Stay, I want you near, like a shadow in my wake
Flow with life down the drain
Memories and force of will sustain
What will be left to show
It's the little things, little things, little things, that make the world
The little things, little things, little things that make the world
Itâ€™s the little things, little things, little things
