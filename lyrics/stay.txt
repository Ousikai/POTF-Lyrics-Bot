Morning comes slow today
Memories push through from yesterday
Where will I be tomorrow
What do I have to show
From my life
Stay 
I need you here for a new day to break
I want you near 
Like a shadow in my wake
Flow with life down the drain
Memories and force of will sustain
What will be left to show
It's the little things
That make the world
