He stares out the window, blank as a canvas
Made up in the sunlight and swirling smoke and ash
He waits for a breath 
Now, taking his time, he sees an eternity in a blink of an eye 
And for him this life is made of time and choices
And endless blend of vistas painted bright with memories
The here and now will bow to him to only serve one purpose
To keep your peace
He takes on the world all in a stride, and your wounds will be his scars
So won't you remember when the night comes
He will need your open arms
For to be invincible, he needs your love
He stands in the doorway, quiet like yesterday
With forgotten throughs become a mystery and nightmares locked away
He looks like a gunman, but his view is much too wide
For such a solution, so he fights without a six gun on his side
And all the while his stars and moon shine brightly
Outside the desert wails a curse of rage and jealousy
And yet tomorrow comes along and shifts to serve his purpose
For to be invincible, he needs your love
