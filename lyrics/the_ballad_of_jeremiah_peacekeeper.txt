He stares out the window
Blank as a canvas
Made up in the sunlight 
And swirling smoke and ash
He waits for a breath 
Now, taking his time
He sees an eternity in a blink of an eye 
And for him this life 
Is made of time and choices
And endless blend of vistas 
Painted bright with memories
The here and now will bow to him 
To only serve one purpose
To keep your peace
He takes on the world all in a stride
And your wounds will be his scars
So won't you remember when the night comes
He will need your open arms
For to be invincible
He needs your love
He stands in the doorway
Quiet like yesterday
With forgotten throughs become a mystery 
And nightmares locked away
He looks like a gunman
But his view is much too wide
For such a solution
So he fights without a six gun on his side
And all the while 
His stars and moon shine brightly
Outside the desert wails 
A curse of rage and jealousy
And yet tomorrow comes along 
And shifts to serve his purpose
