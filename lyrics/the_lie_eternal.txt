I'm here tonight, the passion of your life
To up the stakes, you will be like me in time
So let me come inside, your heart, your mind
Hell, I dare you to see yourself in a different light
Where my hungry desire finds oblivion in your embrace
All mistakes forgiven in your embrace
I'm here, I'm now, arrived I fell into your love
I fell into your lie eternal
I'm here, I'm now, survived I fell into your love
I fell into your lie
You're my sweet trial
All my vestiges of hope pin wishes upon this
To prove I can be right for you and me
This whole damn controversy will shift its course
For better or for worse
In your embrace
All illusions broken in your embrace
If you didn't desire me
My world could never feel more surreal
'Cus its only you can touch me deep enough to heal
N' if you didn't inspire me
Then on my knees I would fall like rain
'Cus its only you can calm me, with your touch
Your voice so softly whispering
I fell into your
I fell into your lie
