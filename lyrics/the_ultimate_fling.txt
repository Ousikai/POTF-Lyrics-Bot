Today, it's in the air again today, another incident that just went off
No way, this time I will not take blame, its pretty obvious who needs to shut up
Ashtrays filled with the fruits of our transgressions, here and there sarcasm overflows
Do stay, I'll need this sitcom to be re-run till I get the gist of just how it goes
What would you have me do
Gimme a reason, c'mon now make my day
Cos I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel
Somehow I've been blindsided by my own kindhearted notion of just who we are
No doubt we'd have collided anyway with me indicted and you raising alarm
First round I'll take my bows into my corner take my vows, regroup and run back again
Bloodhound and of no better pedigree than what you see so you could not offend
Did I act like a fool cos I didn't know what to do,
when you gave me just a little bit more than I bargained for,
a little too much in my hands when my hands are tied
It's the ultimate fling to go frolicking,
licking the muck from the soles of the boots of your pride,
everytime you lied
Spoken my pleas now someone's gotta pay
Can you gimme a reason, movin' into grey
Something I can hold on to at the end of the day
Cos I can't move on till I know what's the deal
