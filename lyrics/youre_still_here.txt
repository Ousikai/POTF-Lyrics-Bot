Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell, rising and falling like rhapsody
And I see winter's broken like lace, in time for a celebration
Thaw wails inside the walls and laughs in the corners, delighting in its evident victory
Till I feel springtime counting its days of flaunting a novel sensation
Like it's leaving, leaving behind the weight vying for yesteryear
Leaving promises in its wake, whispering, my love, you're still here
Hold on to your memories of sundogs and rainbows, as time writes a premature eulogy
And I feel summertime passing in haste, like running out of patience
Quilted with knit and umbrellas and scarfs and a mild understanding of irony
I feel autumn leaving the race, all done with the exhilaration
It's leaving, leaving behind the weight vying for yesteryear
Leaving promises in its wake, whispering, my love, you're still here
Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell, rising and falling in harmony
And I feel winter stealing my days, to herald another creation
